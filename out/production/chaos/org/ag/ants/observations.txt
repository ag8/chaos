For DIM = 10:

F(1,1) is seizure-inducing fill
F(2,2) is seizure-inducing grid
F(3,3) is a converger that descends into chaos
F(4,4) is a cute dance
F(5,5) is a cute dance
F(6,6) is a converger that descends into chaos
F(7,7) is a converger that descends into chaos
F(8,8) is a converger that descends into chaos
F(9,9) is a k-connector that descends into chaos
F(10,10) is a k-disconnector
F(11,11) is a k-connectro that descends into chaos


To do: make sure the board divides (but then all should be k-disconnectors or cute dances!)
